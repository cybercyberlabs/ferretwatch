# Chrome Support Enhancement

## Problem
Chrome extension was missing S3 path-style URL detection, causing it to miss buckets like `https://s3.amazonaws.com/solidarity.tech/images/icons/favicon.png` while Firefox extension detected them correctly.

## Solution
Added `S3_BUCKET_PATH` pattern to detect path-style S3 URLs alongside existing virtual-hosted style detection.

## Changes Made

### Core Fix
- **Added S3_BUCKET_PATH pattern** in `config/patterns.js`
  - Detects: `https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/file.jpg`
  - Maintains existing: `https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.jpg`

### Code Cleanup
- **Unified build system**: Single `build.sh` for all browsers
- **Removed duplicate files**: Eliminated unused popup JS variants
- **Streamlined build process**: Only processes files actually used

## Testing
- ✅ Chrome extension now detects solidarity.tech S3 bucket
- ✅ Firefox compatibility maintained
- ✅ Edge support included
- ✅ All S3 URL patterns covered

## Impact
Chrome extension now has feature parity with Firefox for S3 bucket detection.
