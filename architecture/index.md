## Architecture Principles

### üîí Privacy by Design
- All threat detection happens client-side
- No browsing history collection
- Minimal data transmission
- User consent for all data sharing

### üí∞ Cost Optimization
- CDN-based rule distribution
- Serverless API architecture
- Efficient bandwidth usage
- Scalable infrastructure design

### ‚ö° Performance First
- Local-first processing
- Minimal page load impact
- Efficient resource utilization
- Optimized for mobile devices

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening
- Signed rule pack distribution
- Secure admin interfaces
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Encrypted data transmission
