## Security Overview

### What Bucket Scanning Does

The bucket scanning feature:
- **Detects** cloud storage URLs on web pages
- **Tests** if buckets allow public listing (read-only operations)
- **Reports** potential security misconfigurations
- **Does NOT** download, modify, or access actual bucket contents

### What Bucket Scanning Does NOT Do

The extension explicitly does NOT:
- Download files from buckets
- Store bucket contents locally
- Modify bucket configurations
- Attempt to access private data
- Perform write operations
- Use authentication credentials
- Bypass access controls

## Responsible Usage Guidelines

### Authorized Testing Only

**✅ Appropriate Use:**
- Testing your own organization's buckets
- Security assessments with proper authorization
- Educational research on public resources
- Compliance auditing with appropriate permissions
- Bug bounty programs with explicit scope inclusion

**❌ Inappropriate Use:**
- Testing buckets without permission
- Accessing private or confidential data
- Overwhelming services with excessive requests
- Using findings for malicious purposes
- Violating terms of service or legal agreements

### Professional Security Research

**Guidelines for Security Professionals:**

1. **Obtain Proper Authorization**
   - Written permission for penetration testing
   - Clear scope definition including cloud resources
   - Documented rules of engagement
   - Emergency contact procedures

2. **Follow Responsible Disclosure**
   - Report findings to appropriate parties
   - Allow reasonable time for remediation
   - Avoid public disclosure of sensitive details
   - Coordinate with affected organizations

3. **Document Activities**
   - Maintain audit trails of testing activities
   - Record timestamps and scope of testing
   - Document findings and recommendations
   - Preserve evidence for compliance purposes

### Rate Limiting and Service Respect

**Network Etiquette:**

1. **Respect Rate Limits**
   - Use conservative timeout settings (5+ seconds)
   - Limit concurrent requests (≤3 simultaneous)
   - Implement delays between requests
   - Monitor for rate limiting responses

2. **Avoid Service Disruption**
   - Don't overwhelm target services
   - Use appropriate request intervals
   - Stop testing if errors indicate overload
   - Consider off-peak hours for extensive testing

3. **Configuration Recommendations**
   ```javascript
   // Responsible configuration
   {
     testTimeout: 5000,        // 5 second timeout minimum
     maxConcurrentTests: 3,    // Conservative concurrency
     testPublicAccess: true    // Only test public accessibility
   }
   ```

  provider: 'aws',                            // Provider type only
  accessible: true,                           // Access status only
  timestamp: Date.now(),                      // When discovered
  // Do NOT store: actual contents, file lists, sensitive data
};
```

### Information Security
