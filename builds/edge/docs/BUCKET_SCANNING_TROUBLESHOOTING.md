## Common Issues

### Bucket Scanning Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- No bucket findings despite visible bucket URLs on page
- Extension appears to be working but bucket scanning is silent
- Bucket URLs are detected but not tested for accessibility

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if bucket scanning is enabled:**
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console and run:
   const settings = await browser.storage.local.get('userSettings');
   console.log('Bucket scanning enabled:', settings.userSettings?.cloudBucketScanning?.enabled);
   ```

2. **Verify provider settings:**
   - Open extension settings
   - Navigate to "Cloud Bucket Scanning" section
   - Ensure desired providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) are enabled

3. **Check URL pattern matching:**
   - Supported formats:
     - AWS S3: `s3://bucket-name`, `https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com`, `https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket`
     - GCS: `gs://bucket-name`, `https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket`
     - Azure: `https://account.blob.core.windows.net/container`

### No Notifications for Found Buckets

**Symptoms:**
- Buckets are detected (visible in console logs)
- No visual notifications appear
- Extension popup shows no bucket findings

**Solutions:**

1. **Check notification settings:**
   - Ensure notifications are enabled in extension settings
   - Check if bucket findings meet the risk threshold

2. **Verify bucket accessibility results:**
   ```javascript
   // Check console for bucket test results
   // Look for messages like: "Bucket test completed: [bucket-url] - Status: [accessible/secured]"
   ```

3. **Review risk level filtering:**
   - Open buckets are typically "High" risk
   - Secured buckets are "Low" risk
   - Check if your risk threshold excludes these levels

## Configuration Problems

### Settings Not Saving

**Symptoms:**
- Changes to bucket scanning settings don't persist
- Settings reset to defaults after browser restart
- Error messages when updating settings

**Solutions:**

1. **Check browser storage permissions:**
   - Ensure extension has storage permissions in `about:addons`
   - Try reloading the extension

2. **Clear corrupted settings:**
   ```javascript
   // Reset bucket scanning settings to defaults
   await browser.storage.local.remove('userSettings');
   // Reload the extension
   ```

3. **Validate settings format:**
   ```javascript
   // Correct settings structure:
   {
     cloudBucketScanning: {
       enabled: true,
       providers: {
         aws: true,
         gcp: true,
         azure: true,
         digitalocean: true,
         alibaba: true
       },
       testTimeout: 5000,
       maxConcurrentTests: 3,
       testPublicAccess: true
     }
   }
   ```

### Provider-Specific Issues

**AWS S3 Issues:**
- Ensure URLs match supported patterns
- Some S3 regions may have different URL formats
- Virtual-hosted-style URLs: `https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com`
- Path-style URLs: `https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`

**Google Cloud Storage Issues:**
- Check for both `gs://` and `https://storage.googleapis.com/` formats
- Regional endpoints may not be detected
- Custom domain buckets are not currently supported

**Azure Blob Storage Issues:**
- Only standard blob storage URLs are supported
- Custom domains are not detected
- Ensure container names are included in URLs

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### CORS Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Console errors mentioning "CORS policy"
- Bucket tests failing with network errors
- "Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Understanding CORS limitations:**
   - CORS errors are expected for cross-origin bucket requests
   - The extension handles CORS errors gracefully
   - CORS errors don't necessarily mean the bucket is secured

2. **Check error handling:**
   ```javascript
   // Look for these console messages:
   // "Bucket test failed due to CORS - treating as unknown status"
   // "Network error testing bucket - this is expected for cross-origin requests"
   ```

3. **Verify test results interpretation:**
   - CORS errors are classified as "unknown" status
   - Only successful responses indicate public accessibility
   - Access denied responses indicate secured buckets

### Timeout Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Bucket tests taking too long
- "Request timeout" errors in console
- Scanning appears to hang on certain pages

**Solutions:**

1. **Adjust timeout settings:**
   - Default timeout: 5 seconds
   - Increase for slow networks: 10-15 seconds
   - Decrease for faster scanning: 2-3 seconds

2. **Reduce concurrent tests:**
   - Default: 3 concurrent tests
   - Reduce to 1-2 for slower connections
   - Increase to 5-10 for faster networks (use caution)

3. **Check network stability:**
   - Test on different networks
   - Verify internet connection speed
   - Consider using a VPN if regional restrictions apply

## Performance Issues

### Slow Page Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Pages load slowly when bucket scanning is enabled
- Browser becomes unresponsive during scanning
- High CPU usage during page loads

**Solutions:**

1. **Optimize concurrency settings:**
   ```javascript
   // Reduce concurrent tests
   await settings.updateBucketScanningSettings({
     maxConcurrentTests: 1  // Reduce from default of 3
   });
   ```

2. **Increase timeout for fewer retries:**
   ```javascript
   // Longer timeout reduces retry attempts
   await settings.updateBucketScanningSettings({
     testTimeout: 10000  // 10 seconds instead of 5
   });
   ```

3. **Disable unused providers:**
   ```javascript
   // Only enable providers you need
   await settings.updateBucketScanningSettings({
     providers: {
       aws: true,
       gcp: false,    // Disable if not needed
       azure: false,  // Disable if not needed
       digitalocean: false,
       alibaba: false
     }
   });
   ```

### Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- High memory usage in browser
- Browser tab crashes during scanning
- "Out of memory" errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear scan results regularly:**
   - Results are cached during browsing session
   - Clear browser cache periodically
   - Restart browser if memory usage is high

2. **Limit concurrent operations:**
   - Reduce `maxConcurrentTests` to 1-2
   - Avoid opening many tabs with bucket scanning simultaneously

## False Positives and Negatives

### False Positive Buckets

**Symptoms:**
- Extension reports buckets as "open" when they're actually secured
- Notifications for buckets that don't exist
- Test results don't match manual verification

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify bucket existence:**
   - Manually check bucket URLs in browser
   - Some URLs may be placeholders or examples
   - Check if bucket names contain obvious test patterns

2. **Review detection patterns:**
   - Extension may detect URL-like strings that aren't actual buckets
   - Check context around detected URLs
   - Report persistent false positives for pattern improvement

3. **Manual verification:**
   ```bash
   # Test AWS S3 bucket manually
   curl -I https://bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/
   
   # Test Google Cloud Storage
   curl -I https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-name/
   ```

### Missing Bucket Detections

**Symptoms:**
- Known bucket URLs on page are not detected
- Extension misses obvious bucket references
- Inconsistent detection across similar URLs

**Solutions:**

1. **Check URL formats:**
   - Ensure URLs match supported patterns exactly
   - Some custom domain buckets may not be detected
   - Regional endpoints may use different formats

2. **Review page content:**
   - URLs in JavaScript variables may not be scanned
   - Dynamic content loaded after page load may be missed
   - Try manual page rescan after content loads

3. **Pattern limitations:**
   - Current patterns may not cover all possible formats
   - Custom implementations may use non-standard URLs
   - Report missing patterns for future updates

## Browser-Specific Issues

### Firefox-Specific Issues

**Common problems:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions
- Extension permission limitations
- Network request handling differences

**Solutions:**
- Ensure extension has necessary permissions
- Check for CSP errors in console
- Try disabling other extensions that might interfere

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

**Chrome/Edge differences:**
- API differences between browsers
- Different CORS handling
- Permission model variations

**Solutions:**
- Use Firefox as primary testing browser
- Report browser-specific issues
- Check extension compatibility documentation

## Debugging Steps

### Enable Debug Logging

1. **Open browser console (F12)**
2. **Look for bucket scanning messages:**
   ```
   ü™£ Bucket Scanner: Starting scan for cloud storage URLs
   ü™£ Found bucket URL: [url] (Provider: [provider])
   ü™£ Testing bucket accessibility: [url]
   ü™£ Bucket test completed: [url] - Status: [result]
   ```

3. **Check for error messages:**
   ```
   ‚ùå Bucket test failed: [url] - Error: [details]
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid bucket URL format: [url]
   üîß Bucket scanning disabled in settings
   ```

### Manual Testing

1. **Test bucket detection:**
   ```javascript
   // Create test page with known bucket URLs
   const testContent = `
     s3://my-test-bucket
     https://example-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/
     gs://my-gcs-bucket
   `;
   
   // Check if patterns match
   const patterns = window.BucketPatterns || {};
   console.log('Detected patterns:', patterns);
   ```

2. **Test settings:**
   ```javascript
   // Check current settings
   const settings = await browser.storage.local.get('userSettings');
   console.log('Bucket settings:', settings.userSettings?.cloudBucketScanning);
   
   // Test settings update
   await browser.storage.local.set({
     userSettings: {
       ...settings.userSettings,
       cloudBucketScanning: {
         enabled: true,
         providers: { aws: true, gcp: true, azure: true },
         testTimeout: 5000,
         maxConcurrentTests: 3
       }
     }
   });
   ```

### Network Debugging

1. **Monitor network requests:**
   - Open Network tab in DevTools
   - Look for requests to bucket URLs
   - Check response codes and timing

2. **Test connectivity:**
   ```bash
   # Test basic connectivity to cloud providers
   ping s3.amazonaws.com
   ping storage.googleapis.com
   ping blob.core.windows.net
   ```

| Missing notifications | Check risk threshold and notification settings |

### Security Considerations

**Responsible Usage:**
- Only test buckets you have permission to access
- Don't overwhelm target services with requests
- Respect rate limits and terms of service
- Use findings for legitimate security research only

**Privacy:**
- Extension doesn't store bucket contents
- Only tests for public listing capability
- All processing happens locally in browser
- No data sent to external servers
