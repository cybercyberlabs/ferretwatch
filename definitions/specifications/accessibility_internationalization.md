  - Programmatic access to threat information

## 3. Internationalization (i18n) Requirements

### 3.1 Language Support
- **Primary Languages** (Launch targets):
  - English (en-US) - Default
  - Spanish (es-ES, es-MX)
  - French (fr-FR, fr-CA)
  - German (de-DE)
  - Portuguese (pt-BR)
  - Japanese (ja-JP)
  - Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)

- **Secondary Languages** (6-month targets):
  - Italian (it-IT)
  - Dutch (nl-NL)
  - Korean (ko-KR)
  - Arabic (ar-SA) - RTL support required
  - Russian (ru-RU)

### 3.2 Localization Architecture
- **Message System**:
  - Chrome i18n API with JSON message files
  - Parameterized messages for dynamic content (threat scores, URLs)
  - Context-aware translations for technical vs. user-friendly modes
  - Pluralization support for count-based messages

- **Cultural Adaptation**:
  - Locale-appropriate date/time formatting
  - Number formatting (decimal separators, digit grouping)
  - Currency symbols for financial threat warnings
  - Cultural color associations for threat severity

### 3.3 Right-to-Left (RTL) Support
- **Layout Adaptation**:
  - CSS logical properties for directional layouts
  - RTL-aware icon positioning and alert flow
  - Mirrored threat severity indicators where appropriate
  - Proper text alignment for Arabic and Hebrew

### 3.4 Content Localization
- **Threat Descriptions**:
  - Localized threat category names and explanations
  - Culture-specific examples of phishing tactics
  - Local brand recognition patterns
  - Region-appropriate safe alternative suggestions

- **Campaign Bulletins**:
  - Multi-language bulletin support via locale fields
  - Localized phishing campaign descriptions
  - Regional threat intelligence integration
  - Local authority contact information where relevant

## 4. User Experience Adaptations

### 4.1 Cognitive Accessibility
- **Simplified Interface Mode**:
  - Basic threat indicator without technical details
  - Large, clear action buttons with descriptive text
  - Reduced cognitive load through progressive disclosure
  - Symbol-based communication options

- **Attention & Memory Support**:
  - Persistent threat indicators until acknowledged
  - Clear visual hierarchy in alert panels
  - Minimal working memory requirements for decision-making
  - Contextual help without navigation away from current task

### 4.2 Motor Accessibility
- **Alternative Interaction Methods**:
  - Large click/touch targets (minimum 44√ó44px)
  - Voice control compatibility
  - Switch navigation support
  - Reduced precision requirements for alert interactions

### 4.3 Sensory Accessibility
- **Visual Impairments**:
  - High contrast mode support
  - Screen reader optimization
  - Magnification software compatibility
  - Pattern/texture alternatives to color coding

- **Hearing Impairments**:
  - Visual-only threat notifications (no audio dependencies)
  - Text alternatives for any audio alerts
  - Vibration support where available (mobile)

## 5. Technical Implementation
