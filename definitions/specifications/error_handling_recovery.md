# 🛠️ Error Handling & Recovery Specification

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This document defines comprehensive error handling strategies, recovery mechanisms, and resilience patterns for FerretWatch Enhanced to ensure reliable operation under various failure conditions.

## 2. Error Classification & Response

### 2.1 Critical Errors (Extension Unavailable)
**Definition**: Errors that prevent core threat detection functionality

**Scenarios**:
- Extension startup failure due to corrupted storage
- Manifest parsing errors in rule packs
- WASM YARA engine initialization failure
- Memory exhaustion causing extension termination

**Response Strategy**:
- **User Notification**: Clear error message with recovery instructions
- **Fallback Mode**: Basic browser security warnings only
- **Auto-Recovery**: Attempt restart with clean state after 30 seconds
- **User Action**: Manual reinstall or reset extension option

### 2.2 Degraded Operation (Partial Functionality)
**Definition**: Errors affecting specific detection capabilities but not core operation

**Scenarios**:
- Network failure during rule pack updates
- Corrupted YARA rules subset
- Performance timeout in detection pipeline
- CDN unavailability for intel feeds

**Response Strategy**:
- **Continue Operation**: Use last known good rule pack
- **User Notification**: Subtle indicator showing reduced capability
- **Background Recovery**: Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Skip failed detection modules, continue with others

### 2.3 Transient Errors (Automatic Recovery)
**Definition**: Temporary errors expected during normal operation

**Scenarios**:
- Network timeouts during report submission
- Temporary API rate limiting
- Browser tab crash during detection
- Concurrent access conflicts in local storage

**Response Strategy**:
- **Silent Retry**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **No User Notification**: Handle transparently
- **State Preservation**: Maintain detection state across retries
- **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable failing components

### 2.4 Data Integrity Errors (Security Critical)
**Definition**: Errors indicating potential tampering or corruption

**Scenarios**:
- Rule pack signature verification failure
- Unexpected changes in local storage
- CAPTCHA verification errors during reporting
- Admin bulletin signature mismatch

**Response Strategy**:
- **Immediate Halt**: Stop affected operations immediately
- **User Warning**: Clear security alert with recommended actions
- **Forensic Logging**: Detailed error context for investigation
- **Safe Reset**: Revert to known good state with user consent

## 3. Component-Specific Error Handling

### 3.1 Detection Engine Errors
**YARA Engine Failures**:
- Compilation errors → Skip problematic rules, log for admin review
- Runtime crashes → Restart engine with reduced rule set
- Memory pressure → Reduce scanning scope, increase timeouts
- Performance budget exceeded → Graceful timeout with partial results

**Heuristic Detection Failures**:
- DOM parsing errors → Continue with other detection methods
- Network analysis failures → Use cached reputation data
- Brand matching errors → Skip brand detection, continue analysis
- Homograph detection failures → Fall back to simple string matching

### 3.2 Network & Storage Errors
**CDN/API Communication**:
- Connection timeout → Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- HTTP 429 (Rate Limited) → Honor Retry-After header
- HTTP 5xx errors → Circuit breaker pattern, temporary disable
- SSL/TLS errors → Fail securely, notify user of potential compromise

**Local Storage Failures**:
- Quota exceeded → Implement LRU cache eviction
- Corruption detected → Reset to defaults with user notification
- Permission denied → Request user action or use session storage
- Concurrent modification → Implement optimistic locking with retry

### 3.3 User Interface Errors
**Alert Display Failures**:
- DOM injection blocked → Use safe rendering fallback
- CSS loading failures → Use inline critical styles
- Focus trap failures → Ensure keyboard accessibility maintained
- Animation errors → Disable animations, show static content

**Settings & Configuration**:
- Invalid threshold values → Reset to safe defaults
- Whitelist corruption → Prompt user for verification
- Language pack errors → Fall back to English
- Theme application failures → Use browser default styling

## 4. Recovery Mechanisms

### 4.1 Automatic Recovery Strategies
**Extension Restart**:
- Triggered by: Critical errors, memory leaks, repeated failures
- Process: Clean shutdown → Clear volatile state → Restart with defaults
- User Notification: Brief status message during restart
- Data Preservation: Maintain user settings and whitelists

**Rule Pack Recovery**:
- Corrupted pack → Download fresh copy with integrity verification
- Network failure → Use cached pack with staleness indicator
- Signature failure → Revert to previous verified version
- Delta update failure → Fall back to full pack download

**State Recovery**:
- Session restoration after browser crash
- Detection state recovery across extension updates
- User preferences migration during version changes
- Cache rebuild from authoritative sources

### 4.2 User-Initiated Recovery
**Reset Options**:
- Soft reset → Clear caches, keep user settings
- Hard reset → Complete reinstallation state
- Selective reset → Reset specific components (rules, settings, etc.)
- Export/import → Backup and restore user configuration

**Manual Overrides**:
- Disable specific detection modules temporarily
- Force rule pack refresh
- Clear all cached data
- Report false positive to improve future detection

### 4.3 Progressive Recovery
**Degraded Mode Operation**:
- Level 1 → All detection active
- Level 2 → Disable expensive heuristics
- Level 3 → YARA scanning only
- Level 4 → Basic reputation checks only
- Level 5 → Extension disabled, manual activation required

## 5. Error Reporting & Telemetry

### 5.1 Client-Side Error Logging
**Error Categories**:
- Technical errors with stack traces (no user data)
- Performance budget violations
- Network failures with status codes
- User workflow interruptions

**Data Collection**:
- Error frequency and patterns (aggregated)
- Extension version and browser details
- System resource constraints
- Recovery action success rates

**Privacy Compliance**:
- No URL or content data in error reports
- Opt-in detailed telemetry for debugging
- Local error log rotation (7-day retention)
- User consent for error report transmission

### 5.2 Operational Monitoring
**Alert Thresholds**:
- Error rate > 5% of user sessions
- Critical errors affecting > 1% of users
- Recovery failures > 50% of attempts
- Performance degradation > 20% baseline

**Response Procedures**:
- Automated alert to engineering team
- Emergency rule pack rollback capability
- User communication via bulletin system
- Post-incident review and documentation

## 6. Network Resilience

### 6.1 Offline Operation
**Offline Capabilities**:
- Core detection with cached rule packs
- Local threat scoring and alerts
- User whitelist/blacklist functionality
- Settings management

**Online Resume**:
- Queue reports for submission when connectivity returns
- Sync rule pack updates on reconnection
- Background download of missed bulletins
- Resume interrupted operations gracefully

### 6.2 Network Quality Adaptation
**Poor Connectivity**:
- Increase timeout values dynamically
- Reduce update frequency for rule packs
- Compress API payloads more aggressively
- Prefer cached data over network lookups

**CDN Failover**:
- Multiple CDN endpoints for rule distribution
- Automatic failover with health checking
- Geographic preference with performance monitoring
- Fallback to previous rule pack version if all CDNs fail

## 7. Security Error Handling

### 7.1 Cryptographic Failures
**Signature Verification**:
- Invalid signatures → Reject rule pack, notify user
- Certificate chain issues → Display security warning
- Algorithm deprecation → Graceful upgrade with fallback
- Key rotation → Automatic update with dual-signature period

### 7.2 Abuse Detection
**Potential Attack Scenarios**:
- Rapid-fire report submissions → Rate limiting with CAPTCHA
- Malformed API requests → Request validation and rejection
- Suspicious pattern detection → Enhanced monitoring mode
- Rule pack tampering attempts → Immediate security alert

## 8. Error UX Design

### 8.1 Error Communication
**Error Message Principles**:
- Clear, non-technical language for users
- Specific actionable recovery steps
- Avoid blame language ("you did wrong")
- Provide alternative paths to success

**Progressive Disclosure**:
- Simple error description initially
- "Show details" for technical information
- "Help" link to relevant documentation
- "Report problem" for unresolved issues

### 8.2 Error Prevention
