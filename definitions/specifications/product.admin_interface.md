# üõ†Ô∏è Admin Interface Specification

## 1. Purpose & Scope
A secure, privacy-preserving console for administrators to triage reports, verify findings reproducibly, manage detection rules and bulletins, and maintain product health ‚Äî all with minimal infrastructure cost.

## 2. Roles & Permissions (RBAC)
- Roles
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to dashboards and audit logs
  - **Reviewer**: Triage reports, mark Verified/Rejected/Benign, propose rules
  - **Publisher**: Approve and publish rules and bulletins
  - **Admin**: Manage users, roles, policies, keys, rate limits
  - **Auditor**: Read audit logs and configuration histories, export compliance reports
- Principles
  - **Least privilege** by default; separation of duties between Reviewer and Publisher
  - **Two-person rule**: Publishing requires at least two distinct approvers
  - **Just-in-time elevation**: Time-boxed role elevation with reason and audit entry
