# ⚡ Performance Requirements Specification

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This document defines the performance constraints and resource budgets for FerretWatch Enhanced to ensure a responsive user experience while providing comprehensive threat detection.

## 2. Performance Budgets

### 2.1 Memory Constraints
- **Total Extension Memory**: ≤ 80MB resident across all processes
- **Content Script Memory**: ≤ 15MB per active tab
- **Background Worker Memory**: ≤ 25MB baseline + 5MB per concurrent detection
- **WASM YARA Engine**: ≤ 20MB including rule compilation cache
- **Rule Pack Cache**: ≤ 10MB for offline intel packs and signatures

### 2.2 CPU Utilization Limits
- **Page Load Impact**: ≤ 50ms additional load time per page
- **Background Processing**: ≤ 5% average CPU utilization
- **YARA Scanning**: Hard timeout at 200ms per page with graceful abort
- **Detection Pipeline**: ≤ 100ms total processing time per page
- **Idle State**: ≤ 1% CPU when no active scanning

### 2.3 Network & I/O Constraints
- **Rule Pack Updates**: ≤ 2MB delta download per update cycle
- **CDN Polling**: Maximum once per hour with exponential backoff
- **Report Submission**: ≤ 10KB payload size including evidence
- **Storage Operations**: ≤ 50ms for cache reads/writes

### 2.4 Battery Impact (Mobile)
- **Background Activity**: Minimal wake-ups, batch operations where possible
- **Network Efficiency**: Coalesce requests, respect device power state
- **Processing Optimization**: Prefer efficient algorithms over comprehensive analysis on low-power devices

## 3. Performance Monitoring

### 3.1 Key Metrics
- **Page Load Delay**: Time added to DOMContentLoaded
- **Detection Latency**: Time from navigation to alert display
- **Memory Growth**: Heap size over browsing session duration
- **CPU Spike Detection**: Periods exceeding budget thresholds
- **Cache Hit Ratios**: Efficiency of local rule and brand caches

### 3.2 Performance Telemetry
- **Client-Side Metrics**: Aggregate timing data (no URLs or content)
- **Error Rates**: Timeout, memory pressure, and crash incidents
- **Resource Usage**: Percentile distributions for memory and CPU
- **User Impact**: Performance complaints via feedback mechanism

## 4. Degradation Strategies

### 4.1 Resource Pressure Response
- **Memory Pressure**:
  - Reduce YARA rule active set
  - Clear non-essential caches (brand images, old intel data)
  - Disable optional enrichment features
- **CPU Constraints**:
  - Skip expensive heuristics on resource-constrained devices
  - Reduce YARA scanning scope (HTML only, no JavaScript analysis)
  - Increase detection timeout thresholds
- **Network Limitations**:
  - Extend rule pack update intervals
  - Compress payloads more aggressively
  - Defer non-critical background operations

### 4.2 Graceful Failure Modes
- **Detection Timeout**: Continue with partial results, log for telemetry
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Disable extension temporarily, notify user with recovery option
- **Network Failure**: Operate with last-known rule pack, show staleness indicator
- **Parsing Errors**: Skip problematic rules, continue with remaining detection logic

## 5. Platform-Specific Requirements

### 5.1 Desktop Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Manifest V3 Compliance**: Respect service worker limitations
- **Multi-Process Architecture**: Efficient IPC for detection results
- **Memory Model**: Leverage browser process isolation effectively

### 5.2 Mobile Browsers
- **Reduced Feature Set**: Disable CPU-intensive heuristics by default
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Scale detection complexity based on device capabilities
- **Power Management**: Respect battery saver modes and background restrictions

## 6. Performance Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Automated Testing
- **Load Testing**: 1000+ page simulation with memory/CPU monitoring
- **Stress Testing**: Concurrent tab detection under resource pressure
- **Regression Testing**: Performance benchmark comparison across releases
- **Device Testing**: Low-end device simulation for mobile compatibility

### 6.2 Real-World Validation
- **Field Testing**: Opt-in performance telemetry from beta users
- **A/B Testing**: Performance impact measurement for new features
- **Benchmark Suite**: Standard web pages for consistent performance measurement
- **User Experience**: Page load time impact on popular websites

## 7. Performance Optimization Guidelines

### 7.1 Detection Optimization
- **Early Exit Strategies**: Skip expensive checks when simple heuristics indicate benign content
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching of computed results (domain reputation, brand matching)
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent execution of independent detection modules
- **Incremental Analysis**: Process page content in chunks rather than blocking on full analysis

### 7.2 Resource Management
- **Memory Pools**: Pre-allocate buffers for YARA engine and avoid frequent allocations
- **Background Processing**: Use idle time for rule compilation and cache warming
- **Priority Queuing**: Process high-risk indicators first, defer low-priority checks
- **Resource Sharing**: Share expensive computations across tabs where possible

## 8. Performance Alerts & Escalation

### 8.1 Client-Side Monitoring
- **Performance Budget violations** → Automatic degradation mode activation
- **Memory leaks detected** → Extension restart recommendation
- **Repeated timeouts** → Disable problematic detection modules

### 8.2 Operational Monitoring
- **Aggregate performance degradation** → Investigate rule pack or code regression
- **User complaint patterns** → Emergency performance patch consideration
- **Device-specific issues** → Platform-specific optimization requirements

## 9. Success Criteria

### 9.1 User Experience Targets
- **95th percentile page load impact**: < 100ms
- **User complaint rate**: < 0.1% of active installations
- **Extension disable rate due to performance**: < 0.05% monthly
- **Memory-related crashes**: < 0.01% of browsing sessions

### 9.2 Technical Performance Targets
- **Detection accuracy maintained** while meeting all performance budgets
- **Battery impact on mobile**: Undetectable in normal usage patterns
- **Scalability**: Performance budgets maintained with 10x rule pack growth
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Similar performance characteristics across supported browsers
